# odin-landingpage

Project Outline:

Create a webpage from a design provided by TOP in the form of 2 .png files
    01 - website layout
    02 - design specifications including: fonts, font sizes, font colours, background colours, etc

These images can be found in the ./spec directory

Played around with Flexbox and other CSS properties. Overall quite productive.
